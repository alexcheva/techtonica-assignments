    // Everything in React is a component, and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes. You create a component by extending upon the React-Component class. Let’s create a component called Hello:
      class Hello extends React.Component {  
        //Initializing state
        // To initialize the state, simply set this.state  in the constructor() method of the class. Our state is an object which in our case only has one key called message.
        constructor(){
          //Before we set the state, we have to call super() in the constructor. This is because this is uninitialized before super() has been called.
          super();
          this.state = {
            message: 'my friend (from state)!'
          };
          this.updateMessage = this.updateMessage.bind(this);
        }
        //Changing the state
        // To modify the state, simply call this.setState(), passing in the new state object as the argument. We’ll do this inside a method which we’ll call updateMessage.
        //Note: To make this work, we also had to bind the this keyword to the updateMessage method. Otherwise we couldn’t have accessed this in the method.
        updateMessage(){
          this.setState({
            message: "my friend (from changed state)!"
          });
        }
        //method:
        render() {  
          //Inside render() you’ll return a description of what you want React to draw on the page.
         // return <h1>Hello {this.props.message}!</h1>;  
          //return <h1>Hello {this.state.message}!</h1>;  
          //The reason we’re writing {this.props.message} with curly braces is because we need to tell the JSX that we want to add a JavaScript expression. This is called escaping.
          return (  
            <div>  
              <h1>Hello {this.state.message}!</h1>  
              <button onClick={this.updateMessage}>Click me!</button>  
            </div>     
          )  
          // Here, we’re hooking an event listener onto the button, listening for the onClick event. When this is triggered, we call the updateMessage method.
        }  
      }
      //To get our application to render on the screen, we also have to use ReactDOM.render():
      ReactDOM.render(  
        //This is where we connect our Hello component with the entry point for the app <div id="root"></div>.
          <Hello message="my friend" />,   
          // This prop is called message and has the value “my friend”. We can access this prop inside the Hello component by referencing this.props.message
          document.getElementById("root")
            // Render the Hello component inside the DOM node with an id of root!
      );
