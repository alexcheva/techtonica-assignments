    // Everything in React is a component, and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes. You create a component by extending upon the React-Component class. Let’s create a component called Hello:
      class Hello extends React.Component {  
        //method:
        render() {  
          //Inside render() you’ll return a description of what you want React to draw on the page.
            return <h1>Hello {this.props.message}!</h1>;  
            //The reason we’re writing {this.props.message} with curly braces is because we need to tell the JSX that we want to add a JavaScript expression. This is called escaping.
        }  
      }
      //To get our application to render on the screen, we also have to use ReactDOM.render():
      ReactDOM.render(  
        //This is where we connect our Hello component with the entry point for the app <div id="root"></div>.
          <Hello message="my friend" />,   
          // This prop is called message and has the value “my friend”. We can access this prop inside the Hello component by referencing this.props.message
          document.getElementById("root")
            // Render the Hello component inside the DOM node with an id of root!
      );
